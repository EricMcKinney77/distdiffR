# The distdiffR package for the R computational environment.

An R package for bivariate two-sample tests of distributional equality.

## Overview

This R package provides a collection of bivariate two-sample tests for distributional equality. The tests make use of statistics between empirical distribution functions averaged across a series of rotations and or toroidal shifts of the pooled samples. Another version of the test also exists when combining bivariate data from multiple sources into each of the two-samples, respectively, which treats each contribution equally.
