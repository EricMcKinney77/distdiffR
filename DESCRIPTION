Description: A collection of bivariate two-sample tests for distributional
    equality are provided. The tests make use of statistics between empirical
    distribution functions averaged across a series of rotations and or toroidal
    shifts of the pooled samples. Another version of the test also exists when
    combining bivariate data from multiple sources into each of the two-samples,
    respectively, which treats each contribution equally.
